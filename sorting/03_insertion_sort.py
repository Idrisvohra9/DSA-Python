INSERTION SORT
==============
Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) worst/average case, O(n) best case
Space Complexity: O(1)
Stable: Yes (maintains relative order of equal elements)

How it works:
- Start with second element (assume first is sorted)
- Take current element and find its correct position in sorted portion
- Shift all larger elements one position right
- Insert current element in its correct position
- Repeat for all remaining elements
