BUBBLE SORT
===========
Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) worst/average case, O(n) best case
Space Complexity: O(1)
Stable: Yes (maintains relative order of equal elements)

How it works:
- Compare adjacent elements and swap if they're in wrong order
- After each pass, the largest element "bubbles up" to the end
- Repeat until no more swaps are needed
